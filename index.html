                            <p>This is the classic game of Brick Breaker, in which the player's objective
                                is to strike every brick with the ball. The catch is that the ball must
                                not pass the paddle moving downward.</p>
                            <p>This game was created using Java for both the logic and the GUI.</p>

                                <p>This is another classic most of you probably know. If you are not
                                    familiar I will give you a quick explanation of this very simple game.</p>

                                <p>You, the snake, must eat each of the bugs that are placed on the board. As
                                    you eat more bugs, the snake gets longer. Avoid running into yourself or
                                    the game will end!</p>

                                <p>A perfect example of a hobby that has long been a passion of mine. The 
                                    Suzuki Samurai is one of the best passenger vehicles ever to go
                                    off-road. I personally have been rebuilding one for the past few
                                    years and have learned so much that I want to share with others.</p>
